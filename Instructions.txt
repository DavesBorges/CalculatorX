Welcome to CalculatorX

How it works:
	-Just type your mathematical expression and press enter to get the result. 
		Ex: if you type "2 + 5" you will get 7.
		You can use parentheses to modify the order of evaluation such that if you type "2 * (2 + 1)" the result will be 6
	-CalculatorX supports addition, subraction, division and multiplication.

	VARIABLES
		In addition to the basic operations, CalculatorX also supports variables.  
		You can do all the arithimetic operations with variables
		Here is an example of how to use variables: "let x = 22". This declares a variable named x that holds the value 22
		If I want to modify the variable to hold the value 10 instead of 22 I would simply type "x = 10"


	FUNCTIONS
		You can define your own functions in CalculatorX. As an example, here is how to declare a function that computes 
		the double of a number: "let double(x) = x * 2"
		Functions can zero or more than one argument, for exemple the following function takes 2 parameters and computes their average:
			"let average(x,y) = (x + y) / 2"
		To call a function simply type the name of the function followed by the arguments values. Using as an example the preceding function:
			"average(5,7)" -> the result will be 6


To exit just type "exit" and press enter;

Happy Math time
